# Development Session: 2025-11-12-1817

## Session Overview
**Start Time:** 2025-11-12 18:17
**Project:** Polygon UI - Qt/PySide UI Component Library
**Session Type:** Development Session

## Goals
- Scaffold and plan the Polygon UI project structure
- Set up project foundation for Qt/PySide UI component library
- Create architectural plan for component framework similar to Mantine

## Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Planning Complete
- Analyzed Mantine architecture and documentation
- Created comprehensive implementation plan for Polygon UI
- Added PolyBook component workshop to early development phases
- Plan approved and ready for implementation

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Foundation & PolyBook (Complete)
- **Project Structure Setup**: ✅ Added Qt/PySide dependencies, created modular structure
- **Theme System Core**: ✅ Implemented PolygonProvider and comprehensive Theme system
- **PolyBook Development**: ✅ Built basic component workshop application
  - Complete Qt/PySide integration with PySide6
  - Modular package architecture with core, theme, components, styles, utils, polybook modules
  - Full theme system with colors, spacing, typography, and design tokens
  - PolygonProvider for global theme management and QSS generation
  - Component base class with style props integration
  - PolyBook GUI application with component registry, stories, and live preview
  - Component factory and variant system for extensibility

### ✅ Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Development

## 🛠️ Available Commands

### Poetry Scripts (CLI Commands)
```bash
# Run main application
poetry run polygon-ui

# Launch PolyBook GUI
poetry run polybook
```

### Task Commands (Development)
```bash

```

### 🔄 Phase 2: Styling Architecture (Next)
- **Style Props System**: Complete implementation with all spacing, sizing, color props
- **Styles API Implementation**: Advanced customization and nested selector support
- **QSS Generation**: Enhanced style sheet generation with responsive support

### Upcoming Phases
- Phase 3: Component Architecture (Base Framework enhancement)
- Phase 4: Core Components (Button, Input, Text, Layout)
- Phase 5: PolyBook Enhancement (Advanced features)
- Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
- Phase 7: Distribution & Integration

## 🎉 Key Achievements
1. **Complete Qt/PySide Integration**: Full dependency setup and architecture
2. **Comprehensive Theme System**: Colors, spacing, typography, design tokens
3. **PolyBook Workshop**: Working GUI application for component development
4. **Modular Architecture**: Extensible structure for systematic component addition
5. **Style Props Foundation**: Base implementation ready for component styling
